# Overview

This implements a shared memory realtime and near-realtime radio interface.
This is performed using `shm_td_iq_channel` which handles the shared memory
interface.

# Architecture

The `vrtsim` architecture follows a server-client model:

- **Server (gNB)**: On startup, the server writes connection information to a
  file as provided in `--vrtsim.descriptor`, default location is
  `/tmp/vrtsim_connection`. This file contains information required by the client
  to establish communication.
- **Client (UE)**: The client reads this file from, verifies its contents, and uses
  the provided information to open and connect to the shared memory channel.
- **Shared Memory Channel**: Both server and client use the `shm_td_iq_channel` to
  exchange IQ samples and control data in real time or near-real time.

## Channel modelling:


# Limitations

- 1 gNB supports multiple nrUEs (gNB as a server, UEs as clients), 
- UEs limited to what the system can support in terms of real-time 
  processing requirements.

# Usage

On the UE and gNB: use `device.name vrtsim` command line argument.

Additionally on gNB use `vrtsim.role server` and optionally
`vrtsim.timescale <timescale>` to set the timescale. Timescale 1.0
is the default and means realtime.

To use `vrtsim` in containers, you have to enable inter-process communication,
and mount the directory of the connection information in a shared volume
between server and clients. For instance, in docker and default
`vrtsim.connection_descriptor`, set `ipc: host` and share the server's and
client's `/tmp` directory through a volume. For an example, refer to
[this docker-compose file](../../ci-scripts/yaml_files/5g_vrtsim_cirdb/docker-compose.yaml).

Channel modelling can be enabled by adding `vrtsim.chanmod 1` to the
command line and should work the same as channel modelling in rfsimulator,
see rfsimulator [documentation](../rfsimulator/README.md) with a slight difference:
channel modelling is done on transmission instead of reception. To refect this,
the model names are slightly different: the server expects a model named
`server_tx_channel_model` while the client expects a model named `client_tx_channel_model`

Additionally, `taps_client` is available in vrtsim. This allows to connect to
channel emulation server and receive external taps (or channel impulse responses).
To use external taps, use `--taps-socket` and provide a nanomsg PUB socket address
that will publish the taps.

# Debugging

## Realtime issues

Realtime issues can prevent the UE from connecting to the gNB, especially with
channel modelling enabled. Consider adjusting `timescale` parameter until
the UE can connect reliably.

On exit, vrtsim will output a histogram of the measured transmission budget, which
is defined as the number of microseconds before the transmitted samples could be
read by peer.

Example:

```
[HW]   VRTSIM: Average TX budget 939.210 uS (more is better)

Samples in bin 0 indicate realtime issues.


# Multi-UE Demo
 
Each UE can have different antenna configurations. 
Antenna offset multiplexing handles UL combining and DL distribution across UEs.

For a demo on how to run multiple UEs with channel models see:
https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/raytracing-channel-emulator/-/blob/develop/server/external_taps/README.md?ref_type=heads 

## Build VRTSIM
```bash
cd openairinterface
cmake -B build -GNinja  # the other options you have are not really required
cmake --build build --target vrtsim rfsimulator nr-softmodem nr-uesoftmodem ldpc params_yaml params_libconfig -j"$(nproc)" # also -j not necessarily required
```

## Start 5G core network
```bash
cd oai-cn5g
docker compose up -d
```
 
### Create network namespaces
```bash
sudo ip netns add ue0
sudo ip netns add ue1
```
 
## Start gNB (e.g. 2x1 and 2x2 multi-UE)

On the gNB, set the number of UEs with `vrtsim.num_ues`. 

```bash
sudo ./nr-softmodem -O ../ci-scripts/conf_files/gnb.sa.band78.106prb.vrtsim.2x2.yaml \
  --device.name vrtsim --vrtsim.num_ues 2
```

On each UE, select its slot with `vrtsim.ue_id` and match the antenna counts
configured on the gNB.

```bash
sudo ip netns exec ue0 ./nr-uesoftmodem -O ../ci-scripts/conf_files/nrue.vrtsim.chanmod.yaml -C 3319680000 \
  --device.name vrtsim --vrtsim.ue_id 0 --ue-nb-ant-tx 2 --ue-nb-ant-rx 2

sudo ip netns exec ue1 ./nr-uesoftmodem -O ../ci-scripts/conf_files/nrue.vrtsim.chanmod.yaml -C 3319680000 \
  --device.name vrtsim --vrtsim.ue_id 1 --ue-nb-ant-tx 1 --ue-nb-ant-rx 2
```
